# Template to create configuration file to be used by the ORR system at runtime.
#
# The ${?...} substitution syntax (note the question mark) allows to override settings
# via environment variables. For example, the following under the `mongo` section:
#   host = localhost
#   host = ${?MONGO_HOST}
# indicates that the default value for Mongo host ("localhost") will be overridden with
# the value of the environment variable `MONGO_HOST` if defined.
# See https://github.com/typesafehub/config#optional-system-or-env-variable-overrides
#
# The ${...} substitution syntax (note, *no* question mark) allows to resolve a value
# by taking it from another configuration entry. For example, in
#   replyTo = ${email.account.username}
# the value for `replyTo` will the value assigned to `email.account.username`.
# See https://github.com/typesafehub/config#uses-of-substitutions
